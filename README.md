# Mapping Earthquakes

The objective of this code is to illustrate the severity of the earthquakes in relation to tectonic plates using data from an API call on GitHub. I used d3.json() and then added the data as an overlay to the map using the L.geoJSON() layer to eventually create three different maps(streets, satelliteStreets and dark) for the user to freely choose between them.
